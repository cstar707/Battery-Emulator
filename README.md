# Tesla Model Y Stationary Power Plant

This project is now focused on using Battery-Emulator as the core integration layer for a salvaged Tesla Model Y HV battery pack.

## Primary Reference
- Battery-Emulator: https://github.com/dalathegreat/Battery-Emulator

## Next Steps
- Review Battery-Emulator supported inverter list and Tesla pack support
- Identify required hardware (board, CAN interface, contactor control)
- Map Sol-Ark 12k integration requirements to Battery-Emulator capabilities
